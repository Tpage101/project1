        <div class="faq-question">Why is your Rockey Burger So Expensive?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer1">
                <p>We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like humanely-raised beef that is ground fresh each day, organic chicken, and Rockey Family Dairyâ€™s organic cream for our ice cream cones, sundaes and shakes.</p>
                <p>We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local, family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15% protein to fat blend, a mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak for our ground beef. The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our burgers taste so amazing.</p>
